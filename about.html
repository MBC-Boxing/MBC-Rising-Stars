    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>Moulescoomb Boxing Academy</strong> is a youth-focused, community-rooted boxing programme dedicated to developing confident, disciplined, and skilled young athletes across Sussex.</p>

    <h2>Why We Developed the Programme</h2>
    <p>Too often, children can get lost in traditional boxing gyms without structure, clear progression, or short-term goals. This can lead to young people feeling overlooked or losing motivation.</p>
    <p>We created this structured, 7-level programme to give every child a clear path forward. Each stage helps build confidence, skill, and a sense of achievement — while also promoting personal development both inside and outside the ring.</p>

    <h2>Who Are the Coaches?</h2>
    <p>Your children will be coached by our highly experienced team:</p>
