      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><strong>Moulescoomb Boxing Academy</strong> is a youth-focused, community-rooted boxing programme dedicated to developing confident, disciplined, and skilled young athletes across Sussex. We proudly operate alongside <strong>Moulescoomb ABC</strong>, the competitive boxing club founded by Head Coach Nick Bell. Hayley Weller, who first competed for Moulescoomb ABC, went on to serve as club secretary and matchmaker, and has been instrumental in running our junior and women-only sessions, as well as supporting our competitive squad. Their shared commitment continues to shape both the academy and club into inclusive, high-performing environments for young people to thrive.</p>

      <h2>Why We Developed the Programme</h2>
      <p>Too often, children can get lost in traditional boxing gyms without structure, clear progression, or short-term goals. This can lead to young people feeling overlooked or losing motivation.</p>
      <p>We created this structured, 7-level programme to give every child a clear path forward. Each stage helps build confidence, skill, and a sense of achievement — while also promoting personal development both inside and outside the ring.</p>
