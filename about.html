    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>Moulescoomb Boxing Academy</strong> is a youth-focused, community-rooted boxing programme dedicated to developing confident, disciplined, and skilled young athletes across Sussex.</p>

    <p>Founded by passionate coaches, our academy provides structured training for children aged 10–15. We believe in using boxing as a vehicle to teach life skills and help young people grow both physically and mentally.</p>

    <h2>Why We Developed the Program</h2>
    <p>Too often, children can get lost in traditional boxing gyms where training lacks clear structure, progression, and short-term goals. Without these elements, it’s easy for young people to become demotivated or overlooked.</p>

    <p>We developed this structured 7-level programme to ensure every child receives:
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Purposeful, goal-oriented coaching</li>
        <li>✅ A clear path for progress and recognition</li>
        <li>✅ Personal development support</li>
        <li>✅ The confidence and resilience to thrive both in and out of the ring</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Our focus is on building skill, discipline, and self-belief — not just producing boxers, but empowering young people for life.</p>

    <h2>Who Are the Coaches?</h2>
    <p>Your children will be coached by our highly experienced team:</p>
